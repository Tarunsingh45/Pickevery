Pickevery is a purpose-driven, mobile-based platform that connects travelers heading from cities to rural areas with villagers who need essential goods or shared rides.
🔍 The Problem
•	Villagers often cannot access basic essentials like medicines, books, groceries, or transportation on time.
•	Delivery apps don’t reach rural areas, and public transport is limited or unreliable.
•	People have to travel long distances to nearby cities, wasting time and money.
💡 Your Solution – Pickevery
Pickevery leverages travelers who are already going to rural areas:
•	Villagers submit requests for goods or ride-sharing in the app.
•	Travelers see those requests if they match their route.
•	Travelers accept, fulfill the request, and get rewarded with a small incentive.
•	All travelers are KYC verified, ensuring a trusted and secure network.
In short:
You’re building a bridge between urban movement and rural needs — turning everyday travel into a community-powered delivery and transport solution.
