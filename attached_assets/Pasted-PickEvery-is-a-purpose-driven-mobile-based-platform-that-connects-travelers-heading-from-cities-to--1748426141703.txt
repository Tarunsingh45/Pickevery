PickEvery is a purpose-driven, mobile-based platform that connects travelers heading from cities to rural areas with villagers who need essential goods or shared rides.

🔍 The Problem
Villagers often cannot access basic essentials like medicines, books, groceries, or transportation on time.

Delivery apps don’t reach rural areas, and public transport is limited or unreliable.

People have to travel long distances to nearby cities, wasting time and money.

💡 Your Solution – PickEvery
PickEvery leverages travelers who are already going to rural areas:

Villagers submit requests for goods or ride-sharing in the app.

Travelers see those requests if they match their route.

Travelers accept, fulfill the request, and get rewarded with a small incentive.

All travelers are KYC verified, ensuring a trusted and secure network.

In short:

You’re building a bridge between urban movement and rural needs — turning everyday travel into a community-powered delivery and transport solution.
